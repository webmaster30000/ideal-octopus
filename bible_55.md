Matthew 25:22	He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.
Matthew 25:23	His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
Matthew 25:24	Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:
Matthew 25:25	And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine.
Matthew 25:26	His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:
Matthew 25:27	Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.
Matthew 25:28	Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents.
Matthew 25:29	For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.
Matthew 25:30	And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Matthew 25:31	When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:
Matthew 25:32	And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:
Matthew 25:33	And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.
Matthew 25:34	Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:
Matthew 25:35	For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:
Matthew 25:36	Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.
Matthew 25:37	Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?
Matthew 25:38	When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?
Matthew 25:39	Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?
Matthew 25:40	And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.
Matthew 25:41	Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:
Matthew 25:42	For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:
Matthew 25:43	I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.
Matthew 25:44	Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?
Matthew 25:45	Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.
Matthew 25:46	And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.
Matthew 26:1	And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,
Matthew 26:2	Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.
Matthew 26:3	Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,
Matthew 26:4	And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him.
Matthew 26:5	But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people.
Matthew 26:6	Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
Matthew 26:7	There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.
Matthew 26:8	But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?
Matthew 26:9	For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.
Matthew 26:10	When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.
Matthew 26:11	For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.
Matthew 26:12	For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.
Matthew 26:13	Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.
Matthew 26:14	Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,
Matthew 26:15	And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.
Matthew 26:16	And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.
Matthew 26:17	Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?
Matthew 26:18	And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.
Matthew 26:19	And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.
Matthew 26:20	Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.
Matthew 26:21	And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.
Matthew 26:22	And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?
Matthew 26:23	And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.
Matthew 26:24	The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.
Matthew 26:25	Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.
Matthew 26:26	And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.
Matthew 26:27	And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;
Matthew 26:28	For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.
Matthew 26:29	But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.
Matthew 26:30	And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.
Matthew 26:31	Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.
Matthew 26:32	But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.
Matthew 26:33	Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.
Matthew 26:34	Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.
Matthew 26:35	Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.
Matthew 26:36	Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.
Matthew 26:37	And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.
Matthew 26:38	Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.
Matthew 26:39	And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.
Matthew 26:40	And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?
Matthew 26:41	Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Matthew 26:42	He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.
Matthew 26:43	And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.
Matthew 26:44	And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.
Matthew 26:45	Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
Matthew 26:46	Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.
Matthew 26:47	And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.
Matthew 26:48	Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.
Matthew 26:49	And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.
Matthew 26:50	And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus and took him.
Matthew 26:51	And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.
Matthew 26:52	Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.
Matthew 26:53	Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?
Matthew 26:54	But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?
Matthew 26:55	In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.
Matthew 26:56	But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.
Matthew 26:57	And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.
Matthew 26:58	But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.
Matthew 26:59	Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;
Matthew 26:60	But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,
Matthew 26:61	And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.
Matthew 26:62	And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?
Matthew 26:63	But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.
Matthew 26:64	Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.
Matthew 26:65	Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.
Matthew 26:66	What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.
Matthew 26:67	Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,
Matthew 26:68	Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?
Matthew 26:69	Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.
Matthew 26:70	But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.
Matthew 26:71	And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.
Matthew 26:72	And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.
Matthew 26:73	And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.
Matthew 26:74	Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.
Matthew 26:75	And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.
Matthew 27:1	When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:
Matthew 27:2	And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.
Matthew 27:3	Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
Matthew 27:4	Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.
Matthew 27:5	And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.
Matthew 27:6	And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.
Matthew 27:7	And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.
Matthew 27:8	Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.
Matthew 27:9	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;
Matthew 27:10	And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.
Matthew 27:11	And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.
Matthew 27:12	And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.
Matthew 27:13	Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?
Matthew 27:14	And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.
Matthew 27:15	Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.
Matthew 27:16	And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.
Matthew 27:17	Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?
Matthew 27:18	For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.
Matthew 27:19	When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.
Matthew 27:20	But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
Matthew 27:21	The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.
Matthew 27:22	Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.
Matthew 27:23	And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.
Matthew 27:24	When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it.
Matthew 27:25	Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.
Matthew 27:26	Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.
Matthew 27:27	Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.
Matthew 27:28	And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.
Matthew 27:29	And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!
Matthew 27:30	And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.
Matthew 27:31	And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.
Matthew 27:32	And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.
Matthew 27:33	And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,
Matthew 27:34	They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.
Matthew 27:35	And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.
Matthew 27:36	And sitting down they watched him there;
Matthew 27:37	And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
Matthew 27:38	Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.
Matthew 27:39	And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,
Matthew 27:40	And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.
Matthew 27:41	Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,
Matthew 27:42	He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.
Matthew 27:43	He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.
Matthew 27:44	The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.
Matthew 27:45	Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.
Matthew 27:46	And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
Matthew 27:47	Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias.
Matthew 27:48	And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.
Matthew 27:49	The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.
Matthew 27:50	Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.
Matthew 27:51	And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;
Matthew 27:52	And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,
Matthew 27:53	And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.
Matthew 27:54	Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.
Matthew 27:55	And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:
Matthew 27:56	Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedees children.
Matthew 27:57	When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:
Matthew 27:58	He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.
Matthew 27:59	And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
Matthew 27:60	And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.
Matthew 27:61	And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.
Matthew 27:62	Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,
Matthew 27:63	Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.
Matthew 27:64	Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.
Matthew 27:65	Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can.
Matthew 27:66	So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.
Matthew 28:1	In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.
Matthew 28:2	And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.
Matthew 28:3	His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:
Matthew 28:4	And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.
Matthew 28:5	And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.
Matthew 28:6	He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.
Matthew 28:7	And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.
Matthew 28:8	And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.
Matthew 28:9	And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.
Matthew 28:10	Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.
Matthew 28:11	Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.
Matthew 28:12	And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,
Matthew 28:13	Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.
Matthew 28:14	And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.
Matthew 28:15	So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.
Matthew 28:16	Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.
Matthew 28:17	And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.
Matthew 28:18	And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.
Matthew 28:19	Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:
Matthew 28:20	Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.
Mark 1:1	The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;
Mark 1:2	As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.
Mark 1:3	The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
Mark 1:4	John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.
Mark 1:5	And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.
Mark 1:6	And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;
Mark 1:7	And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.
Mark 1:8	I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.
Mark 1:9	And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.
Mark 1:10	And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:
Mark 1:11	And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
Mark 1:12	And immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness.
Mark 1:13	And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.
Mark 1:14	Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,
Mark 1:15	And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.
Mark 1:16	Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.
Mark 1:17	And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.
Mark 1:18	And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.
Mark 1:19	And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.
Mark 1:20	And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.
Mark 1:21	And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.
Mark 1:22	And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.
Mark 1:23	And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,
Mark 1:24	Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.
Mark 1:25	And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.
Mark 1:26	And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.
Mark 1:27	And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.
Mark 1:28	And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.
Mark 1:29	And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
Mark 1:30	But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.
Mark 1:31	And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.
Mark 1:32	And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.
Mark 1:33	And all the city was gathered together at the door.
Mark 1:34	And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.
Mark 1:35	And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.
Mark 1:36	And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.
Mark 1:37	And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for thee.
Mark 1:38	And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.
Mark 1:39	And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.
Mark 1:40	And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
Mark 1:41	And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.
Mark 1:42	And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.
Mark 1:43	And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;
Mark 1:44	And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.
Mark 1:45	But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.
Mark 2:1	And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was noised that he was in the house.
Mark 2:2	And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them.
Mark 2:3	And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four.
Mark 2:4	And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.
Mark 2:5	When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.
Mark 2:6	But there was certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,
Mark 2:7	Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?
Mark 2:8	And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?
Mark 2:9	Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?
Mark 2:10	But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,)
Mark 2:11	I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.
Mark 2:12	And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.
Mark 2:13	And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.
Mark 2:14	And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.
Mark 2:15	And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.
Mark 2:16	And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?
Mark 2:17	When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
Mark 2:18	And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?
Mark 2:19	And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
Mark 2:20	But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.
Mark 2:21	No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse.
Mark 2:22	And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles.
Mark 2:23	And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.
Mark 2:24	And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?
Mark 2:25	And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him?
Mark 2:26	How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?
Mark 2:27	And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:
Mark 2:28	Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.
Mark 3:1	And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a withered hand.
Mark 3:2	And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him.
Mark 3:3	And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand forth.
Mark 3:4	And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their peace.
Mark 3:5	And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.
Mark 3:6	And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.
Mark 3:7	But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,
Mark 3:8	And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him.
Mark 3:9	And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.
Mark 3:10	For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues.
Mark 3:11	And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.
Mark 3:12	And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.
Mark 3:13	And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he would: and they came unto him.
Mark 3:14	And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,
Mark 3:15	And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:
Mark 3:16	And Simon he surnamed Peter;
Mark 3:17	And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:
Mark 3:18	And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,
Mark 3:19	And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into an house.
Mark 3:20	And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.
Mark 3:21	And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.
Mark 3:22	And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils.
Mark 3:23	And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?
Mark 3:24	And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
Mark 3:25	And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
Mark 3:26	And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end.
Mark 3:27	No man can enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house.
Mark 3:28	Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme:
Mark 3:29	But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation.
Mark 3:30	Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.
Mark 3:31	There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him.
Mark 3:32	And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.
Mark 3:33	And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?
Mark 3:34	And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!
Mark 3:35	For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.
Mark 4:1	And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.
Mark 4:2	And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,
Mark 4:3	Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:
Mark 4:4	And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.
Mark 4:5	And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:
Mark 4:6	But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.
Mark 4:7	And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.
Mark 4:8	And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.
Mark 4:9	And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
Mark 4:10	And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.
Mark 4:11	And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables:
Mark 4:12	That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.
Mark 4:13	And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?
Mark 4:14	The sower soweth the word.
Mark 4:15	And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.
Mark 4:16	And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;
Mark 4:17	And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended.
Mark 4:18	And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,
Mark 4:19	And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.
Mark 4:20	And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.
Mark 4:21	And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?
Mark 4:22	For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.
Mark 4:23	If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.
Mark 4:24	And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.
Mark 4:25	For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.
Mark 4:26	And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;
Mark 4:27	And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.
Mark 4:28	For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.
Mark 4:29	But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.
Mark 4:30	And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?
Mark 4:31	It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:
Mark 4:32	But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.
Mark 4:33	And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it.
Mark 4:34	But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.
Mark 4:35	And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.
Mark 4:36	And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.
Mark 4:37	And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.
Mark 4:38	And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?
Mark 4:39	And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
Mark 4:40	And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?
Mark 4:41	And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?
Mark 5:1	And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.
Mark 5:2	And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,
Mark 5:3	Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:
Mark 5:4	Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him.
Mark 5:5	And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.
Mark 5:6	But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,
Mark 5:7	And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.
Mark 5:8	For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit.
Mark 5:9	And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many.
Mark 5:10	And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.
Mark 5:11	Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.
Mark 5:12	And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.
Mark 5:13	And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.
Mark 5:14	And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.
Mark 5:15	And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.
Mark 5:16	And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine.
Mark 5:17	And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.
Mark 5:18	And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him.
Mark 5:19	Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.
Mark 5:20	And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel.
Mark 5:21	And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea.
Mark 5:22	And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,
Mark 5:23	And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live.
Mark 5:24	And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him.
Mark 5:25	And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,
Mark 5:26	And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,
Mark 5:27	When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment.
Mark 5:28	For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.
Mark 5:29	And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague.
Mark 5:30	And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?
Mark 5:31	And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?
Mark 5:32	And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.
Mark 5:33	But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.
Mark 5:34	And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.
Mark 5:35	While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further?
Mark 5:36	As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.
Mark 5:37	And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.
Mark 5:38	And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.
Mark 5:39	And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.
Mark 5:40	And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.
Mark 5:41	And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise.
Mark 5:42	And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment.
Mark 5:43	And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.
Mark 6:1	And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him.
Mark 6:2	And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?
Mark 6:3	Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.
Mark 6:4	But Jesus, said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.
Mark 6:5	And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them.
Mark 6:6	And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching.
Mark 6:7	And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;
Mark 6:8	And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse:
Mark 6:9	But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.
Mark 6:10	And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place.
Mark 6:11	And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.
Mark 6:12	And they went out, and preached that men should repent.
Mark 6:13	And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.
Mark 6:14	And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.
Mark 6:15	Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.
Mark 6:16	But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.
Mark 6:17	For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her.
Mark 6:18	For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife.
Mark 6:19	Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:
Mark 6:20	For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.
Mark 6:21	And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee;
Mark 6:22	And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.
Mark 6:23	And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.
Mark 6:24	And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.
Mark 6:25	And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist.
Mark 6:26	And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.
Mark 6:27	And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,
Mark 6:28	And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother.
Mark 6:29	And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.
Mark 6:30	And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.
Mark 6:31	And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.
Mark 6:32	And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.
Mark 6:33	And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto him.
Mark 6:34	And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.
Mark 6:35	And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed:
Mark 6:36	Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat.
Mark 6:37	He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?
Mark 6:38	He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.
Mark 6:39	And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass.
Mark 6:40	And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.
Mark 6:41	And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.
Mark 6:42	And they did all eat, and were filled.
Mark 6:43	And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.
Mark 6:44	And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.
Mark 6:45	And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.
Mark 6:46	And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.
Mark 6:47	And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.
Mark 6:48	And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.
Mark 6:49	But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out:
Mark 6:50	For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.
Mark 6:51	And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.
Mark 6:52	For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their heart was hardened.
Mark 6:53	And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.
Mark 6:54	And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him,
Mark 6:55	And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.
Mark 6:56	And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.
Mark 7:1	Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.
Mark 7:2	And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.
Mark 7:3	For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.
Mark 7:4	And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.
Mark 7:5	Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?
Mark 7:6	He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
Mark 7:7	Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.
Mark 7:8	For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.
Mark 7:9	And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.
Mark 7:10	For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:
Mark 7:11	But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free.
