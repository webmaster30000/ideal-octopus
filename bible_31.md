Job 20:24	He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall strike him through.
Job 20:25	It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him.
Job 20:26	All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle.
Job 20:27	The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him.
Job 20:28	The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath.
Job 20:29	This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.
Job 21:1	But Job answered and said,
Job 21:2	Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.
Job 21:3	Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.
Job 21:4	As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled?
Job 21:5	Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth.
Job 21:6	Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.
Job 21:7	Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?
Job 21:8	Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.
Job 21:9	Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them.
Job 21:10	Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.
Job 21:11	They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.
Job 21:12	They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.
Job 21:13	They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.
Job 21:14	Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.
Job 21:15	What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?
Job 21:16	Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
Job 21:17	How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows in his anger.
Job 21:18	They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away.
Job 21:19	God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it.
Job 21:20	His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
Job 21:21	For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?
Job 21:22	Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.
Job 21:23	One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.
Job 21:24	His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.
Job 21:25	And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure.
Job 21:26	They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.
Job 21:27	Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me.
Job 21:28	For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked?
Job 21:29	Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens,
Job 21:30	That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.
Job 21:31	Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done?
Job 21:32	Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb.
Job 21:33	The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him.
Job 21:34	How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?
Job 22:1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
Job 22:2	Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself?
Job 22:3	Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?
Job 22:4	Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment?
Job 22:5	Is not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite?
Job 22:6	For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing.
Job 22:7	Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.
Job 22:8	But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it.
Job 22:9	Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.
Job 22:10	Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee;
Job 22:11	Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee.
Job 22:12	Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are!
Job 22:13	And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud?
Job 22:14	Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.
Job 22:15	Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?
Job 22:16	Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood:
Job 22:17	Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them?
Job 22:18	Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
Job 22:19	The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn.
Job 22:20	Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth.
Job 22:21	Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee.
Job 22:22	Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart.
Job 22:23	If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.
Job 22:24	Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks.
Job 22:25	Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver.
Job 22:26	For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God.
Job 22:27	Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows.
Job 22:28	Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.
Job 22:29	When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting up; and he shall save the humble person.
Job 22:30	He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands.
Job 23:1	Then Job answered and said,
Job 23:2	Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.
Job 23:3	Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat!
Job 23:4	I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.
Job 23:5	I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.
Job 23:6	Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me.
Job 23:7	There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.
Job 23:8	Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:
Job 23:9	On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:
Job 23:10	But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.
Job 23:11	My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.
Job 23:12	Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.
Job 23:13	But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.
Job 23:14	For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him.
Job 23:15	Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.
Job 23:16	For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:
Job 23:17	Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he covered the darkness from my face.
Job 24:1	Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?
Job 24:2	Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed thereof.
Job 24:3	They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox for a pledge.
Job 24:4	They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together.
Job 24:5	Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children.
Job 24:6	They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked.
Job 24:7	They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold.
Job 24:8	They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.
Job 24:9	They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor.
Job 24:10	They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry;
Job 24:11	Which make oil within their walls, and tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst.
Job 24:12	Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.
Job 24:13	They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.
Job 24:14	The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief.
Job 24:15	The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.
Job 24:16	In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.
Job 24:17	For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death.
Job 24:18	He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.
Job 24:19	Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave those which have sinned.
Job 24:20	The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.
Job 24:21	He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow.
Job 24:22	He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life.
Job 24:23	Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes are upon their ways.
Job 24:24	They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.
Job 24:25	And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?
Job 25:1	Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
Job 25:2	Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high places.
Job 25:3	Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise?
Job 25:4	How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?
Job 25:5	Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars are not pure in his sight.
Job 25:6	How much less man, that is a worm? and the son of man, which is a worm?
Job 26:1	But Job answered and said,
Job 26:2	How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest thou the arm that hath no strength?
Job 26:3	How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?
Job 26:4	To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?
Job 26:5	Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.
Job 26:6	Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.
Job 26:7	He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.
Job 26:8	He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.
Job 26:9	He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it.
Job 26:10	He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.
Job 26:11	The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.
Job 26:12	He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud.
Job 26:13	By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.
Job 26:14	Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?
Job 27:1	Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,
Job 27:2	As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul;
Job 27:3	All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils;
Job 27:4	My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.
Job 27:5	God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.
Job 27:6	My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.
Job 27:7	Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous.
Job 27:8	For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?
Job 27:9	Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?
Job 27:10	Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?
Job 27:11	I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.
Job 27:12	Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus altogether vain?
Job 27:13	This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty.
Job 27:14	If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.
Job 27:15	Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep.
Job 27:16	Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay;
Job 27:17	He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.
Job 27:18	He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the keeper maketh.
Job 27:19	The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he is not.
Job 27:20	Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night.
Job 27:21	The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place.
Job 27:22	For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand.
Job 27:23	Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.
Job 28:1	Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where they fine it.
Job 28:2	Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the stone.
Job 28:3	He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.
Job 28:4	The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men.
Job 28:5	As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire.
Job 28:6	The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold.
Job 28:7	There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's eye hath not seen:
Job 28:8	The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it.
Job 28:9	He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots.
Job 28:10	He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing.
Job 28:11	He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light.
Job 28:12	But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding?
Job 28:13	Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living.
Job 28:14	The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me.
Job 28:15	It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.
Job 28:16	It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.
Job 28:17	The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold.
Job 28:18	No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is above rubies.
Job 28:19	The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold.
Job 28:20	Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding?
Job 28:21	Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air.
Job 28:22	Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.
Job 28:23	God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.
Job 28:24	For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven;
Job 28:25	To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure.
Job 28:26	When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:
Job 28:27	Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out.
Job 28:28	And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.
Job 29:1	Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,
Job 29:2	Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me;
Job 29:3	When his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through darkness;
Job 29:4	As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle;
Job 29:5	When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me;
Job 29:6	When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;
Job 29:7	When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared my seat in the street!
Job 29:8	The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and stood up.
Job 29:9	The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth.
Job 29:10	The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.
Job 29:11	When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me:
Job 29:12	Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him.
Job 29:13	The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.
Job 29:14	I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem.
Job 29:15	I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.
Job 29:16	I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out.
Job 29:17	And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.
Job 29:18	Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand.
Job 29:19	My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch.
Job 29:20	My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.
Job 29:21	Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.
Job 29:22	After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.
Job 29:23	And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.
Job 29:24	If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.
Job 29:25	I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one that comforteth the mourners.
Job 30:1	But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.
Job 30:2	Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom old age was perished?
Job 30:3	For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.
Job 30:4	Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their meat.
Job 30:5	They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as after a thief;)
Job 30:6	To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks.
Job 30:7	Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.
Job 30:8	They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.
Job 30:9	And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.
Job 30:10	They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.
Job 30:11	Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.
Job 30:12	Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.
Job 30:13	They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.
Job 30:14	They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me.
Job 30:15	Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.
Job 30:16	And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.
Job 30:17	My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.
Job 30:18	By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.
Job 30:19	He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.
Job 30:20	I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me not.
Job 30:21	Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.
Job 30:22	Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it, and dissolvest my substance.
Job 30:23	For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.
Job 30:24	Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.
Job 30:25	Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the poor?
Job 30:26	When I looked for good, then evil came unto me: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.
Job 30:27	My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.
Job 30:28	I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the congregation.
Job 30:29	I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.
Job 30:30	My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.
Job 30:31	My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.
Job 31:1	I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?
Job 31:2	For what portion of God is there from above? and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high?
Job 31:3	Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity?
Job 31:4	Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?
Job 31:5	If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;
Job 31:6	Let me be weighed in an even balance that God may know mine integrity.
Job 31:7	If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;
Job 31:8	Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out.
Job 31:9	If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid wait at my neighbour's door;
Job 31:10	Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her.
Job 31:11	For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges.
Job 31:12	For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase.
Job 31:13	If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me;
Job 31:14	What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?
Job 31:15	Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?
Job 31:16	If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;
Job 31:17	Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;
Job 31:18	(For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;)
Job 31:19	If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;
Job 31:20	If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;
Job 31:21	If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate:
Job 31:22	Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone.
Job 31:23	For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.
Job 31:24	If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence;
Job 31:25	If I rejoice because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had gotten much;
Job 31:26	If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness;
Job 31:27	And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand:
Job 31:28	This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the God that is above.
Job 31:29	If I rejoice at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him:
Job 31:30	Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.
Job 31:31	If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied.
Job 31:32	The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors to the traveller.
Job 31:33	If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom:
Job 31:34	Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door?
Job 31:35	Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book.
Job 31:36	Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me.
Job 31:37	I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him.
Job 31:38	If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;
Job 31:39	If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:
Job 31:40	Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.
Job 32:1	So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
Job 32:2	Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.
Job 32:3	Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.
Job 32:4	Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.
Job 32:5	When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.
Job 32:6	And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.
Job 32:7	I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.
Job 32:8	But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.
Job 32:9	Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.
Job 32:10	Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.
Job 32:11	Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.
Job 32:12	Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:
Job 32:13	Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.
Job 32:14	Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.
Job 32:15	They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.
Job 32:16	When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;)
Job 32:17	I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.
Job 32:18	For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.
Job 32:19	Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.
Job 32:20	I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.
Job 32:21	Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.
Job 32:22	For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would soon take me away.
Job 33:1	Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.
Job 33:2	Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.
Job 33:3	My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.
Job 33:4	The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.
Job 33:5	If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up.
Job 33:6	Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay.
Job 33:7	Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.
Job 33:8	Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying,
Job 33:9	I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me.
Job 33:10	Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,
Job 33:11	He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.
Job 33:12	Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.
Job 33:13	Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.
Job 33:14	For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.
Job 33:15	In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;
Job 33:16	Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,
Job 33:17	That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.
Job 33:18	He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.
Job 33:19	He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:
Job 33:20	So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.
Job 33:21	His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.
Job 33:22	Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.
Job 33:23	If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:
Job 33:24	Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.
Job 33:25	His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth:
Job 33:26	He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.
Job 33:27	He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;
Job 33:28	He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.
Job 33:29	Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,
Job 33:30	To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.
Job 33:31	Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.
Job 33:32	If thou hast anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.
Job 33:33	If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.
Job 34:1	Furthermore Elihu answered and said,
Job 34:2	Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.
Job 34:3	For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.
Job 34:4	Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.
Job 34:5	For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.
Job 34:6	Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression.
Job 34:7	What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?
Job 34:8	Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.
Job 34:9	For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.
Job 34:10	Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.
Job 34:11	For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.
Job 34:12	Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.
Job 34:13	Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?
Job 34:14	If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;
Job 34:15	All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.
Job 34:16	If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.
Job 34:17	Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?
Job 34:18	Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly?
Job 34:19	How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.
Job 34:20	In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.
Job 34:21	For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.
Job 34:22	There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
Job 34:23	For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.
Job 34:24	He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.
Job 34:25	Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.
Job 34:26	He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
Job 34:27	Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:
Job 34:28	So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.
Job 34:29	When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:
Job 34:30	That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.
Job 34:31	Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:
Job 34:32	That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.
Job 34:33	Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.
Job 34:34	Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.
Job 34:35	Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.
Job 34:36	My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men.
Job 34:37	For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.
Job 35:1	Elihu spake moreover, and said,
Job 35:2	Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God's?
Job 35:3	For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?
Job 35:4	I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.
Job 35:5	Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou.
Job 35:6	If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?
Job 35:7	If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?
Job 35:8	Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man.
Job 35:9	By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.
Job 35:10	But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;
Job 35:11	Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?
Job 35:12	There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.
Job 35:13	Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.
Job 35:14	Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him.
Job 35:15	But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity:
Job 35:16	Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.
Job 36:1	Elihu also proceeded, and said,
Job 36:2	Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf.
Job 36:3	I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
Job 36:4	For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.
Job 36:5	Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.
Job 36:6	He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.
Job 36:7	He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.
Job 36:8	And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction;
Job 36:9	Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.
Job 36:10	He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.
Job 36:11	If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.
Job 36:12	But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.
Job 36:13	But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.
Job 36:14	They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.
Job 36:15	He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.
Job 36:16	Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.
Job 36:17	But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee.
Job 36:18	Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.
Job 36:19	Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.
Job 36:20	Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.
Job 36:21	Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.
Job 36:22	Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?
Job 36:23	Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?
Job 36:24	Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.
Job 36:25	Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.
Job 36:26	Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.
Job 36:27	For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:
Job 36:28	Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.
Job 36:29	Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle?
Job 36:30	Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.
Job 36:31	For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.
Job 36:32	With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.
Job 36:33	The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.
Job 37:1	At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place.
Job 37:2	Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth.
Job 37:3	He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.
Job 37:4	After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.
Job 37:5	God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.
Job 37:6	For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.
Job 37:7	He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.
Job 37:8	Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.
Job 37:9	Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.
Job 37:10	By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.
Job 37:11	Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud:
Job 37:12	And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth.
Job 37:13	He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.
Job 37:14	Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.
Job 37:15	Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?
Job 37:16	Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?
Job 37:17	How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind?
Job 37:18	Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass?
Job 37:19	Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.
Job 37:20	Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.
Job 37:21	And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.
Job 37:22	Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty.
Job 37:23	Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.
Job 37:24	Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart.
Job 38:1	Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
