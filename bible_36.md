Psalms 104:4	Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:
Psalms 104:5	Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever.
Psalms 104:6	Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.
Psalms 104:7	At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.
Psalms 104:8	They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.
Psalms 104:9	Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.
Psalms 104:10	He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills.
Psalms 104:11	They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst.
Psalms 104:12	By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which sing among the branches.
Psalms 104:13	He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.
Psalms 104:14	He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;
Psalms 104:15	And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart.
Psalms 104:16	The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;
Psalms 104:17	Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house.
Psalms 104:18	The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks for the conies.
Psalms 104:19	He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.
Psalms 104:20	Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.
Psalms 104:21	The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.
Psalms 104:22	The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.
Psalms 104:23	Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.
Psalms 104:24	O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.
Psalms 104:25	So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.
Psalms 104:26	There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein.
Psalms 104:27	These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season.
Psalms 104:28	That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.
Psalms 104:29	Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.
Psalms 104:30	Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.
Psalms 104:31	The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works.
Psalms 104:32	He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.
Psalms 104:33	I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.
Psalms 104:34	My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD.
Psalms 104:35	Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.
Psalms 105:1	O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people.
Psalms 105:2	Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works.
Psalms 105:3	Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.
Psalms 105:4	Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.
Psalms 105:5	Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;
Psalms 105:6	O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen.
Psalms 105:7	He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth.
Psalms 105:8	He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations.
Psalms 105:9	Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;
Psalms 105:10	And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant:
Psalms 105:11	Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:
Psalms 105:12	When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.
Psalms 105:13	When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people;
Psalms 105:14	He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;
Psalms 105:15	Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.
Psalms 105:16	Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.
Psalms 105:17	He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant:
Psalms 105:18	Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:
Psalms 105:19	Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.
Psalms 105:20	The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free.
Psalms 105:21	He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:
Psalms 105:22	To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.
Psalms 105:23	Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
Psalms 105:24	And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.
Psalms 105:25	He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.
Psalms 105:26	He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.
Psalms 105:27	They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.
Psalms 105:28	He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.
Psalms 105:29	He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.
Psalms 105:30	Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.
Psalms 105:31	He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all their coasts.
Psalms 105:32	He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.
Psalms 105:33	He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.
Psalms 105:34	He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,
Psalms 105:35	And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.
Psalms 105:36	He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.
Psalms 105:37	He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes.
Psalms 105:38	Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.
Psalms 105:39	He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.
Psalms 105:40	The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
Psalms 105:41	He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river.
Psalms 105:42	For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.
Psalms 105:43	And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness:
Psalms 105:44	And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people;
Psalms 105:45	That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD.
Psalms 106:1	Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Psalms 106:2	Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth all his praise?
Psalms 106:3	Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness at all times.
Psalms 106:4	Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;
Psalms 106:5	That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.
Psalms 106:6	We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.
Psalms 106:7	Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea.
Psalms 106:8	Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.
Psalms 106:9	He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.
Psalms 106:10	And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
Psalms 106:11	And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.
Psalms 106:12	Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.
Psalms 106:13	They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:
Psalms 106:14	But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.
Psalms 106:15	And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.
Psalms 106:16	They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD.
Psalms 106:17	The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the company of Abiram.
Psalms 106:18	And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.
Psalms 106:19	They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.
Psalms 106:20	Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.
Psalms 106:21	They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;
Psalms 106:22	Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea.
Psalms 106:23	Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.
Psalms 106:24	Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:
Psalms 106:25	But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.
Psalms 106:26	Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:
Psalms 106:27	To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.
Psalms 106:28	They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.
Psalms 106:29	Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.
Psalms 106:30	Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.
Psalms 106:31	And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.
Psalms 106:32	They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:
Psalms 106:33	Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.
Psalms 106:34	They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:
Psalms 106:35	But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.
Psalms 106:36	And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.
Psalms 106:37	Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,
Psalms 106:38	And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.
Psalms 106:39	Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.
Psalms 106:40	Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.
Psalms 106:41	And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.
Psalms 106:42	Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.
Psalms 106:43	Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.
Psalms 106:44	Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:
Psalms 106:45	And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.
Psalms 106:46	He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.
Psalms 106:47	Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.
Psalms 106:48	Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.
Psalms 107:1	O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Psalms 107:2	Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;
Psalms 107:3	And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.
Psalms 107:4	They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.
Psalms 107:5	Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
Psalms 107:6	Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses.
Psalms 107:7	And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.
Psalms 107:8	Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!
Psalms 107:9	For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.
Psalms 107:10	Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron;
Psalms 107:11	Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:
Psalms 107:12	Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help.
Psalms 107:13	Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses.
Psalms 107:14	He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.
Psalms 107:15	Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!
Psalms 107:16	For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder.
Psalms 107:17	Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.
Psalms 107:18	Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death.
Psalms 107:19	Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses.
Psalms 107:20	He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.
Psalms 107:21	Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!
Psalms 107:22	And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.
Psalms 107:23	They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;
Psalms 107:24	These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.
Psalms 107:25	For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof.
Psalms 107:26	They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.
Psalms 107:27	They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit's end.
Psalms 107:28	Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.
Psalms 107:29	He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.
Psalms 107:30	Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.
Psalms 107:31	Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!
Psalms 107:32	Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.
Psalms 107:33	He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;
Psalms 107:34	A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
Psalms 107:35	He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.
Psalms 107:36	And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;
Psalms 107:37	And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.
Psalms 107:38	He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.
Psalms 107:39	Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.
Psalms 107:40	He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way.
Psalms 107:41	Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock.
Psalms 107:42	The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.
Psalms 107:43	Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.
Psalms 108:1	O god, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory.
Psalms 108:2	Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.
Psalms 108:3	I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.
Psalms 108:4	For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds.
Psalms 108:5	Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth;
Psalms 108:6	That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand, and answer me.
Psalms 108:7	God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
Psalms 108:8	Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;
Psalms 108:9	Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph.
Psalms 108:10	Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?
Psalms 108:11	Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts?
Psalms 108:12	Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.
Psalms 108:13	Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.
Psalms 109:1	Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;
Psalms 109:2	For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.
Psalms 109:3	They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.
Psalms 109:4	For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto prayer.
Psalms 109:5	And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.
Psalms 109:6	Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.
Psalms 109:7	When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.
Psalms 109:8	Let his days be few; and let another take his office.
Psalms 109:9	Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.
Psalms 109:10	Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places.
Psalms 109:11	Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.
Psalms 109:12	Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.
Psalms 109:13	Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out.
Psalms 109:14	Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.
Psalms 109:15	Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.
Psalms 109:16	Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.
Psalms 109:17	As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.
Psalms 109:18	As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.
Psalms 109:19	Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.
Psalms 109:20	Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.
Psalms 109:21	But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake: because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me.
Psalms 109:22	For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.
Psalms 109:23	I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.
Psalms 109:24	My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.
Psalms 109:25	I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me they shaked their heads.
Psalms 109:26	Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:
Psalms 109:27	That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD, hast done it.
Psalms 109:28	Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.
Psalms 109:29	Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.
Psalms 109:30	I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.
Psalms 109:31	For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from those that condemn his soul.
Psalms 110:1	The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.
Psalms 110:2	The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.

Psalms 113:5	Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high,
Psalms 113:6	Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth!
Psalms 113:7	He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill;
Psalms 113:8	That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people.
Psalms 113:9	He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the LORD.
Psalms 114:1	When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language;
Psalms 114:2	Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion.
Psalms 114:3	The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back.
Psalms 114:4	The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs.
