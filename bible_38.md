Proverbs 3:10	So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.
Proverbs 3:11	My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:
Proverbs 3:12	For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.
Proverbs 3:13	Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.
Proverbs 3:14	For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.
Proverbs 3:15	She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.
Proverbs 3:16	Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour.
Proverbs 3:17	Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.
Proverbs 3:18	She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her.

Proverbs 3:23	Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.
Proverbs 3:24	When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.

Proverbs 3:27	Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.
Proverbs 3:28	Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.
Proverbs 3:29	Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.
Proverbs 3:30	Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.
Proverbs 3:31	Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.|
Proverbs 3:32	For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the righteous.
Proverbs 3:33	The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.
Proverbs 3:34	Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.
Proverbs 3:35	The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.
Proverbs 4:1	Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.
Proverbs 4:2	For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.
Proverbs 4:3	For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.
Proverbs 4:4	He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.
Proverbs 4:5	Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.
Proverbs 4:6	Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.
Proverbs 4:7	Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.
Proverbs 4:8	Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.
Proverbs 4:9	She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.
Proverbs 4:10	Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.
Proverbs 4:11	I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths.
Proverbs 4:12	When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.
Proverbs 4:13	Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life.
Proverbs 4:14	Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men.
Proverbs 4:15	Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.
Proverbs 4:16	For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.
Proverbs 4:17	For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.
Proverbs 4:18	But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.
Proverbs 4:19	The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.
Proverbs 4:20	My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.
Proverbs 4:21	Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.
Proverbs 4:22	For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.
Proverbs 4:23	Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.
Proverbs 4:24	Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.

Proverbs 4:26	Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.
Proverbs 4:27	Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.
Proverbs 5:1	My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding:
Proverbs 5:2	That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.
Proverbs 5:3	For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:
Proverbs 5:4	But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.
Proverbs 5:5	Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.
Proverbs 5:6	Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them.
Proverbs 5:7	Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.
Proverbs 5:8	Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:
Proverbs 5:9	Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel:
Proverbs 5:10	Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger;
Proverbs 5:11	And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,
Proverbs 5:12	And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;
Proverbs 5:13	And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!
Proverbs 5:14	I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.
Proverbs 5:15	Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.
Proverbs 5:16	Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets.
Proverbs 5:17	Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.
Proverbs 5:18	Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.
Proverbs 5:19	Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.
Proverbs 5:20	And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?
Proverbs 5:21	For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.
Proverbs 5:22	His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.
Proverbs 5:23	He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.
Proverbs 6:1	My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,
Proverbs 6:2	Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.
Proverbs 6:3	Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.
Proverbs 6:4	Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.
Proverbs 6:5	Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.
Proverbs 6:6	Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:
Proverbs 6:7	Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,
Proverbs 6:8	Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.
Proverbs 6:9	How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?
Proverbs 6:10	Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:
Proverbs 6:11	So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.
Proverbs 6:12	A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.
Proverbs 6:13	He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;
Proverbs 6:14	Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.
Proverbs 6:15	Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.
Proverbs 6:16	These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him:
Proverbs 6:17	A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,
Proverbs 6:18	An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,
Proverbs 6:19	A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.
Proverbs 6:20	My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:
Proverbs 6:21	Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck.
Proverbs 6:22	When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.
Proverbs 6:23	For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:
Proverbs 6:24	To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.
Proverbs 6:25	Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.
Proverbs 6:26	For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adultress will hunt for the precious life.
Proverbs 6:27	Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?
Proverbs 6:28	Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?
Proverbs 6:29	So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.
Proverbs 6:30	Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;
Proverbs 6:31	But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.
Proverbs 6:32	But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.
Proverbs 6:33	A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.
Proverbs 6:34	For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
Proverbs 6:35	He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.
Proverbs 7:1	My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.
Proverbs 7:2	Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.
Proverbs 7:3	Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.
Proverbs 7:4	Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman:
Proverbs 7:5	That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth with her words.
Proverbs 7:6	For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,
Proverbs 7:7	And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,
Proverbs 7:8	Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,
Proverbs 7:9	In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:
Proverbs 7:10	And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.
Proverbs 7:11	(She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:
Proverbs 7:12	Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)
Proverbs 7:13	So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him,
Proverbs 7:14	I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.
Proverbs 7:15	Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.
Proverbs 7:16	I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt.
Proverbs 7:17	I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
Proverbs 7:18	Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.
Proverbs 7:19	For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey:
Proverbs 7:20	He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed.
Proverbs 7:21	With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.
Proverbs 7:22	He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;
Proverbs 7:23	Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.
Proverbs 7:24	Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.
Proverbs 7:25	Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.
Proverbs 7:26	For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have been slain by her.
Proverbs 7:27	Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.
Proverbs 8:1	Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?
Proverbs 8:2	She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.
Proverbs 8:3	She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.
Proverbs 8:4	Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.
Proverbs 8:5	O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.
Proverbs 8:6	Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things.
Proverbs 8:7	For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
Proverbs 8:8	All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing froward or perverse in them.
Proverbs 8:9	They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.
Proverbs 8:10	Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.
Proverbs 8:11	For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.
Proverbs 8:12	I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.
Proverbs 8:13	The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.
Proverbs 8:14	Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength.
Proverbs 8:15	By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.
Proverbs 8:16	By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.
Proverbs 8:17	I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.
Proverbs 8:18	Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness.
Proverbs 8:19	My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.
Proverbs 8:20	I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:
Proverbs 8:21	That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.
Proverbs 8:22	The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.
Proverbs 8:23	I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.
Proverbs 8:24	When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water.
Proverbs 8:25	Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:
Proverbs 8:26	While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.
Proverbs 8:27	When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:
Proverbs 8:28	When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:
Proverbs 8:29	When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:
Proverbs 8:30	Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him;
Proverbs 8:31	Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men.
Proverbs 8:32	Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are they that keep my ways.
Proverbs 8:33	Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.
Proverbs 8:34	Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.
Proverbs 8:35	For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD.
Proverbs 8:36	But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.

Proverbs 9:13	A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knoweth nothing.
Proverbs 9:14	For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,
Proverbs 9:15	To call passengers who go right on their ways:
Proverbs 9:16	Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,
Proverbs 9:17	Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.
Proverbs 9:18	But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her guests are in the depths of hell.
