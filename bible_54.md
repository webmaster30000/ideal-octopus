Matthew 13:46	Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.
Matthew 13:47	Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:
Matthew 13:48	Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.
Matthew 13:49	So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,
Matthew 13:50	And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
Matthew 13:51	Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.
Matthew 13:52	Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.
Matthew 13:53	And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.
Matthew 13:54	And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?
Matthew 13:55	Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?
Matthew 13:56	And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?
Matthew 13:57	And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.
Matthew 13:58	And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
Matthew 14:1	At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,
Matthew 14:2	And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.
Matthew 14:3	For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife.
Matthew 14:4	For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.
Matthew 14:5	And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.
Matthew 14:6	But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod.
Matthew 14:7	Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask.
Matthew 14:8	And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a charger.
Matthew 14:9	And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her.
Matthew 14:10	And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.
Matthew 14:11	And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother.
Matthew 14:12	And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus.
Matthew 14:13	When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities.
Matthew 14:14	And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.
Matthew 14:15	And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.
Matthew 14:16	But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat.
Matthew 14:17	And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes.
Matthew 14:18	He said, Bring them hither to me.
Matthew 14:19	And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
Matthew 14:20	And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.
Matthew 14:21	And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.
Matthew 14:22	And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.
Matthew 14:23	And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.
Matthew 14:24	But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.
Matthew 14:25	And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.
Matthew 14:26	And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.
Matthew 14:27	But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.
Matthew 14:28	And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.
Matthew 14:29	And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.
Matthew 14:30	But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.
Matthew 14:31	And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?
Matthew 14:32	And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.
Matthew 14:33	Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.
Matthew 14:34	And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.
Matthew 14:35	And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased;
Matthew 14:36	And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.
Matthew 15:1	Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,
Matthew 15:2	Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.
Matthew 15:3	But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?
Matthew 15:4	For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.
Matthew 15:5	But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;
Matthew 15:6	And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.
Matthew 15:7	Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,
Matthew 15:8	This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.
Matthew 15:9	But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.
Matthew 15:10	And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:
Matthew 15:11	Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.
Matthew 15:12	Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?
Matthew 15:13	But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.
Matthew 15:14	Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.
Matthew 15:15	Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.
Matthew 15:16	And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?
Matthew 15:17	Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?
Matthew 15:18	But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.
Matthew 15:19	For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:
Matthew 15:20	These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.
Matthew 15:21	Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.
Matthew 15:22	And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.
Matthew 15:23	But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.
Matthew 15:24	But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
Matthew 15:25	Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.
Matthew 15:26	But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.
Matthew 15:27	And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.
Matthew 15:28	Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.
Matthew 15:29	And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.
Matthew 15:30	And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:
Matthew 15:31	Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.
Matthew 15:32	Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.
Matthew 15:33	And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?
Matthew 15:34	And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.
Matthew 15:35	And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.
Matthew 15:36	And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
Matthew 15:37	And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full.
Matthew 15:38	And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.
Matthew 15:39	And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala.
Matthew 16:1	The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven.
Matthew 16:2	He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red.
Matthew 16:3	And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowering. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?
Matthew 16:4	A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed.
Matthew 16:5	And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.
Matthew 16:6	Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.
Matthew 16:7	And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no bread.
Matthew 16:8	Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?
Matthew 16:9	Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
Matthew 16:10	Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
Matthew 16:11	How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?
Matthew 16:12	Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.
Matthew 16:13	When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?
Matthew 16:14	And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.
Matthew 16:15	He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?
Matthew 16:16	And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.
Matthew 16:17	And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.
Matthew 16:18	And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
Matthew 16:19	And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
Matthew 16:20	Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ.
Matthew 16:21	From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.
Matthew 16:22	Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.
Matthew 16:23	But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.
Matthew 16:24	Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
Matthew 16:25	For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.
Matthew 16:26	For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
Matthew 16:27	For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.
Matthew 16:28	Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.
Matthew 17:1	And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart,
Matthew 17:2	And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.
Matthew 17:3	And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him.
Matthew 17:4	Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.
Matthew 17:5	While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.
Matthew 17:6	And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid.
Matthew 17:7	And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid.
Matthew 17:8	And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only.
Matthew 17:9	And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead.
Matthew 17:10	And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?
Matthew 17:11	And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.
Matthew 17:12	But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.
Matthew 17:13	Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.
Matthew 17:14	And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying,
Matthew 17:15	Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water.
Matthew 17:16	And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.
Matthew 17:17	Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me.
Matthew 17:18	And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.
Matthew 17:19	Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?
Matthew 17:20	And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.
Matthew 17:21	Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.
Matthew 17:22	And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:
Matthew 17:23	And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again. And they were exceeding sorry.
Matthew 17:24	And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?
Matthew 17:25	He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers?
Matthew 17:26	Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free.
Matthew 17:27	Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.
Matthew 18:1	At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?
Matthew 18:2	And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,
Matthew 18:3	And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew 18:4	Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew 18:5	And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.
Matthew 18:6	But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.
Matthew 18:7	Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!
Matthew 18:8	Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.
Matthew 18:9	And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.
Matthew 18:10	Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.
Matthew 18:11	For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.
Matthew 18:12	How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?
Matthew 18:13	And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.
Matthew 18:14	Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.
Matthew 18:15	Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.
Matthew 18:16	But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.
Matthew 18:17	And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.
Matthew 18:18	Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
Matthew 18:19	Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.
Matthew 18:20	For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.
Matthew 18:21	Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?
Matthew 18:22	Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.
Matthew 18:23	Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants.
Matthew 18:24	And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents.
Matthew 18:25	But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.
Matthew 18:26	The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.
Matthew 18:27	Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.
Matthew 18:28	But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.
Matthew 18:29	And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.
Matthew 18:30	And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.
Matthew 18:31	So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.
Matthew 18:32	Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me:
Matthew 18:33	Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?
Matthew 18:34	And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.
Matthew 18:35	So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.
Matthew 19:1	And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan;
Matthew 19:2	And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.
Matthew 19:3	The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?
Matthew 19:4	And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,
Matthew 19:5	And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?
Matthew 19:6	Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.
Matthew 19:7	They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?
Matthew 19:8	He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.
Matthew 19:9	And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.
Matthew 19:10	His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry.
Matthew 19:11	But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.
Matthew 19:12	For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.
Matthew 19:13	Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.
Matthew 19:14	But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew 19:15	And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.
Matthew 19:16	And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?
Matthew 19:17	And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.
Matthew 19:18	He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,
Matthew 19:19	Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
Matthew 19:20	The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?
Matthew 19:21	Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.
Matthew 19:22	But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.
Matthew 19:23	Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew 19:24	And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
Matthew 19:25	When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?
Matthew 19:26	But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.
Matthew 19:27	Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?
Matthew 19:28	And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
Matthew 19:29	And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.
Matthew 19:30	But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.
Matthew 20:1	For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.
Matthew 20:2	And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
Matthew 20:3	And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,
Matthew 20:4	And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.
Matthew 20:5	Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.
Matthew 20:6	And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?
Matthew 20:7	They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive.
Matthew 20:8	So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first.
Matthew 20:9	And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.
Matthew 20:10	But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.
Matthew 20:11	And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house,
Matthew 20:12	Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day.
Matthew 20:13	But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?
Matthew 20:14	Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee.
Matthew 20:15	Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?
Matthew 20:16	So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.
Matthew 20:17	And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them,
Matthew 20:18	Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,
Matthew 20:19	And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.
Matthew 20:20	Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.
Matthew 20:21	And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom.
Matthew 20:22	But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able.
Matthew 20:23	And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.
Matthew 20:24	And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation against the two brethren.
Matthew 20:25	But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them.
Matthew 20:26	But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;
Matthew 20:27	And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:
Matthew 20:28	Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
Matthew 20:29	And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.
Matthew 20:30	And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David.
Matthew 20:31	And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David.
Matthew 20:32	And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I shall do unto you?
Matthew 20:33	They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
Matthew 20:34	So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.
Matthew 21:1	And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,
Matthew 21:2	Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them unto me.
Matthew 21:3	And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them.
Matthew 21:4	All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,
Matthew 21:5	Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass.
Matthew 21:6	And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,
Matthew 21:7	And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon.
Matthew 21:8	And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way.
Matthew 21:9	And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.
Matthew 21:10	And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?
Matthew 21:11	And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.
Matthew 21:12	And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,
Matthew 21:13	And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.
Matthew 21:14	And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them.
Matthew 21:15	And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore displeased,
Matthew 21:16	And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?
Matthew 21:17	And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there.
Matthew 21:18	Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.
Matthew 21:19	And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away.
Matthew 21:20	And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away!
Matthew 21:21	Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.
Matthew 21:22	And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.
Matthew 21:23	And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?
Matthew 21:24	And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things.
Matthew 21:25	The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him?
Matthew 21:26	But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet.
Matthew 21:27	And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.
Matthew 21:28	But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.
Matthew 21:29	He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.
Matthew 21:30	And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not.
Matthew 21:31	Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.
Matthew 21:32	For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him.
Matthew 21:33	Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country:
Matthew 21:34	And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.
Matthew 21:35	And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.
Matthew 21:36	Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise.
Matthew 21:37	But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.
Matthew 21:38	But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance.
Matthew 21:39	And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him.
Matthew 21:40	When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen?
Matthew 21:41	They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.
Matthew 21:42	Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?
Matthew 21:43	Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.
Matthew 21:44	And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.
Matthew 21:45	And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them.
Matthew 21:46	But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.
Matthew 22:1	And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,
Matthew 22:2	The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son,
Matthew 22:3	And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.
Matthew 22:4	Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage.
Matthew 22:5	But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:
Matthew 22:6	And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them.
Matthew 22:7	But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.
Matthew 22:8	Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.
Matthew 22:9	Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage.
Matthew 22:10	So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.
Matthew 22:11	And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:
Matthew 22:12	And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.
Matthew 22:13	Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Matthew 22:14	For many are called, but few are chosen.
Matthew 22:15	Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk.
Matthew 22:16	And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men.
Matthew 22:17	Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?
Matthew 22:18	But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?
Matthew 22:19	Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.
Matthew 22:20	And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?
Matthew 22:21	They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.
Matthew 22:22	When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.
Matthew 22:23	The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,
Matthew 22:24	Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
Matthew 22:25	Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:
Matthew 22:26	Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.
Matthew 22:27	And last of all the woman died also.
Matthew 22:28	Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.
Matthew 22:29	Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.
Matthew 22:30	For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.
Matthew 22:31	But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,
Matthew 22:32	I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
Matthew 22:33	And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.
Matthew 22:34	But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.
Matthew 22:35	Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,
Matthew 22:36	Master, which is the great commandment in the law?
Matthew 22:37	Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
Matthew 22:38	This is the first and great commandment.
Matthew 22:39	And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
Matthew 22:40	On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.
Matthew 22:41	While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,
Matthew 22:42	Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, The son of David.
Matthew 22:43	He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying,
Matthew 22:44	The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?
Matthew 22:45	If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?
Matthew 22:46	And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.
Matthew 23:1	Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,
Matthew 23:2	Saying The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:
Matthew 23:3	All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.
Matthew 23:4	For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.
Matthew 23:5	But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,
Matthew 23:6	And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,
Matthew 23:7	And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.
Matthew 23:8	But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren.
Matthew 23:9	And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.
Matthew 23:10	Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ.
Matthew 23:11	But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.
Matthew 23:12	And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.
Matthew 23:13	But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.
Matthew 23:14	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.
Matthew 23:15	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.
Matthew 23:16	Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!
Matthew 23:17	Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?
Matthew 23:18	And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty.
Matthew 23:19	Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?
Matthew 23:20	Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon.
Matthew 23:21	And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein.
Matthew 23:22	And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon.
Matthew 23:23	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.
Matthew 23:24	Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.
Matthew 23:25	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.
Matthew 23:26	Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.
Matthew 23:27	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.
Matthew 23:28	Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
Matthew 23:29	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous,
Matthew 23:30	And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.
Matthew 23:31	Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets.
Matthew 23:32	Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.
Matthew 23:33	Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?
Matthew 23:34	Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city:
Matthew 23:35	That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.
Matthew 23:36	Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation.
Matthew 23:37	O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!
Matthew 23:38	Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.
Matthew 23:39	For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
Matthew 24:1	And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple.
Matthew 24:2	And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.
Matthew 24:3	And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?
Matthew 24:4	And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.
Matthew 24:5	For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.
Matthew 24:6	And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
Matthew 24:7	For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.
Matthew 24:8	All these are the beginning of sorrows.
Matthew 24:9	Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
Matthew 24:10	And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.
Matthew 24:11	And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.
Matthew 24:12	And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.
Matthew 24:13	But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.
Matthew 24:14	And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.
Matthew 24:15	When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:)
Matthew 24:16	Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:
Matthew 24:17	Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house:
Matthew 24:18	Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes.
Matthew 24:19	And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!
Matthew 24:20	But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day:
Matthew 24:21	For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.
Matthew 24:22	And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.
Matthew 24:23	Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not.
Matthew 24:24	For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.
Matthew 24:25	Behold, I have told you before.
Matthew 24:26	Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.
Matthew 24:27	For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
Matthew 24:28	For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.
Matthew 24:29	Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:
Matthew 24:30	And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
Matthew 24:31	And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
Matthew 24:32	Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh:
Matthew 24:33	So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.
Matthew 24:34	Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.
Matthew 24:35	Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.
Matthew 24:36	But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.
Matthew 24:37	But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
Matthew 24:38	For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,
Matthew 24:39	And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
Matthew 24:40	Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
Matthew 24:41	Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
Matthew 24:42	Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.
Matthew 24:43	But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.
Matthew 24:44	Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.
Matthew 24:45	Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?
Matthew 24:46	Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.
Matthew 24:47	Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods.
Matthew 24:48	But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming;
Matthew 24:49	And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;
Matthew 24:50	The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of,
Matthew 24:51	And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Matthew 25:1	Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
Matthew 25:2	And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.
Matthew 25:3	They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:
Matthew 25:4	But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
Matthew 25:5	While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.
Matthew 25:6	And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.
Matthew 25:7	Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
Matthew 25:8	And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.
Matthew 25:9	But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.
Matthew 25:10	And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.
Matthew 25:11	Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.
Matthew 25:12	But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.
Matthew 25:13	Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.
Matthew 25:14	For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.
Matthew 25:15	And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.
Matthew 25:16	Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents.
Matthew 25:17	And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.
Matthew 25:18	But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.
Matthew 25:19	After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.
Matthew 25:20	And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.
Matthew 25:21	His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
