Mark 7:12	And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;
Mark 7:13	Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.
Mark 7:14	And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:
Mark 7:15	There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.
Mark 7:16	If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.
Mark 7:17	And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.
Mark 7:18	And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;
Mark 7:19	Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?
Mark 7:20	And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.
Mark 7:21	For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,
Mark 7:22	Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:
Mark 7:23	All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.
Mark 7:24	And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it: but he could not be hid.
Mark 7:25	For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:
Mark 7:26	The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.
Mark 7:27	But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it unto the dogs.
Mark 7:28	And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.
Mark 7:29	And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.
Mark 7:30	And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.
Mark 7:31	And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.
Mark 7:32	And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.
Mark 7:33	And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;
Mark 7:34	And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.
Mark 7:35	And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.
Mark 7:36	And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it;
Mark 7:37	And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.
Mark 8:1	In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them,
Mark 8:2	I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:
Mark 8:3	And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.
Mark 8:4	And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness?
Mark 8:5	And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.
Mark 8:6	And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before the people.
Mark 8:7	And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before them.
Mark 8:8	So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets.
Mark 8:9	And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.
Mark 8:10	And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.
Mark 8:11	And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.
Mark 8:12	And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.
Mark 8:13	And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.
Mark 8:14	Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.
Mark 8:15	And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.
Mark 8:16	And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have no bread.
Mark 8:17	And when Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?
Mark 8:18	Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?
Mark 8:19	When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.
Mark 8:20	And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.
Mark 8:21	And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?
Mark 8:22	And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him.
Mark 8:23	And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.
Mark 8:24	And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.
Mark 8:25	After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.
Mark 8:26	And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town.
Mark 8:27	And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?
Mark 8:28	And they answered, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.
Mark 8:29	And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.
Mark 8:30	And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.
Mark 8:31	And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.
Mark 8:32	And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.
Mark 8:33	But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.
Mark 8:34	And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
Mark 8:35	For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it.
Mark 8:36	For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?
Mark 8:37	Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
Mark 8:38	Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.
Mark 9:1	And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.
Mark 9:2	And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them.
Mark 9:3	And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them.
Mark 9:4	And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus.
Mark 9:5	And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.
Mark 9:6	For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid.
Mark 9:7	And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.
Mark 9:8	And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with themselves.
Mark 9:9	And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead.
Mark 9:10	And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean.
Mark 9:11	And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must first come?
Mark 9:12	And he answered and told them, Elias verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought.
Mark 9:13	But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.
Mark 9:14	And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them.
Mark 9:15	And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him.
Mark 9:16	And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them?
Mark 9:17	And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit;
Mark 9:18	And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could not.
Mark 9:19	He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me.
Mark 9:20	And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.
Mark 9:21	And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto him? And he said, Of a child.
Mark 9:22	And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us.
Mark 9:23	Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.
Mark 9:24	And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.
Mark 9:25	When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.
Mark 9:26	And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead.
Mark 9:27	But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.
Mark 9:28	And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?
Mark 9:29	And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.
Mark 9:30	And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it.
Mark 9:31	For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day.
Mark 9:32	But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.
Mark 9:33	And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?
Mark 9:34	But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who should be the greatest.
Mark 9:35	And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all.
Mark 9:36	And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,
Mark 9:37	Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.
Mark 9:38	And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, because he followeth not us.
Mark 9:39	But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me.
Mark 9:40	For he that is not against us is on our part.
Mark 9:41	For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward.
Mark 9:42	And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.
Mark 9:43	And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:
Mark 9:44	Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
Mark 9:45	And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:
Mark 9:46	Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
Mark 9:47	And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:
Mark 9:48	Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
Mark 9:49	For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.
Mark 9:50	Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another.
Mark 10:1	And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto him again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again.
Mark 10:2	And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting him.
Mark 10:3	And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?
Mark 10:4	And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away.
Mark 10:5	And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept.
Mark 10:6	But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.
Mark 10:7	For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife;
Mark 10:8	And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh.
Mark 10:9	What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.
Mark 10:10	And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter.
Mark 10:11	And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her.
Mark 10:12	And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.
Mark 10:13	And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them.
Mark 10:14	But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.
Mark 10:15	Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.
Mark 10:16	And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them.
Mark 10:17	And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?
Mark 10:18	And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God.
Mark 10:19	Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother.
Mark 10:20	And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth.
Mark 10:21	Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.
Mark 10:22	And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions.
Mark 10:23	And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!
Mark 10:24	And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!
Mark 10:25	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
Mark 10:26	And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?
Mark 10:27	And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.
Mark 10:28	Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.
Mark 10:29	And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,
Mark 10:30	But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.
Mark 10:31	But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.
Mark 10:32	And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him,
Mark 10:33	Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:
Mark 10:34	And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.
Mark 10:35	And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire.
Mark 10:36	And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?
Mark 10:37	They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.
Mark 10:38	But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?
Mark 10:39	And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:
Mark 10:40	But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.
Mark 10:41	And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John.
Mark 10:42	But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.
Mark 10:43	But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:
Mark 10:44	And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.
Mark 10:45	For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
Mark 10:46	And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.
Mark 10:47	And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.
Mark 10:48	And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me.
Mark 10:49	And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.
Mark 10:50	And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.
Mark 10:51	And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.
Mark 10:52	And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.
Mark 11:1	And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,
Mark 11:2	And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him.
Mark 11:3	And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither.
Mark 11:4	And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.
Mark 11:5	And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?
Mark 11:6	And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they let them go.
Mark 11:7	And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him.
Mark 11:8	And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way.
Mark 11:9	And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord:
Mark 11:10	Blessed be the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.
Mark 11:11	And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.
Mark 11:12	And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry:
Mark 11:13	And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.
Mark 11:14	And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it.
Mark 11:15	And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;
Mark 11:16	And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple.
Mark 11:17	And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves.
Mark 11:18	And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was astonished at his doctrine.
Mark 11:19	And when even was come, he went out of the city.
Mark 11:20	And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.
Mark 11:21	And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.
Mark 11:22	And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.
Mark 11:23	For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.
Mark 11:24	Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.
Mark 11:25	And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.
Mark 11:26	But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.
Mark 11:27	And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders,
Mark 11:28	And say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority to do these things?
Mark 11:29	And Jesus answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
Mark 11:30	The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me.
Mark 11:31	And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?
Mark 11:32	But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all men counted John, that he was a prophet indeed.
Mark 11:33	And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.
Mark 12:1	And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a place for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.
Mark 12:2	And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.
Mark 12:3	And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.
Mark 12:4	And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled.
Mark 12:5	And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some.
Mark 12:6	Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.
Mark 12:7	But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be our's.
Mark 12:8	And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.
Mark 12:9	What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.
Mark 12:10	And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:
Mark 12:11	This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?
Mark 12:12	And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.
Mark 12:13	And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in his words.
Mark 12:14	And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?
Mark 12:15	Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see it.
Mark 12:16	And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's.
Mark 12:17	And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him.
Mark 12:18	Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,
Mark 12:19	Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
Mark 12:20	Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.
Mark 12:21	And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.
Mark 12:22	And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.
Mark 12:23	In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.
Mark 12:24	And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?
Mark 12:25	For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.
Mark 12:26	And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?
Mark 12:27	He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.
Mark 12:28	And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?
Mark 12:29	And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:
Mark 12:30	And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.
Mark 12:31	And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.
Mark 12:32	And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:
Mark 12:33	And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.
Mark 12:34	And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.
Mark 12:35	And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David?
Mark 12:36	For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.
Mark 12:37	David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.
Mark 12:38	And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces,
Mark 12:39	And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:
Mark 12:40	Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.
Mark 12:41	And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.
Mark 12:42	And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.
Mark 12:43	And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:
Mark 12:44	For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.
Mark 13:1	And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!
Mark 13:2	And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.
Mark 13:3	And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,
Mark 13:4	Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?
Mark 13:5	And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man deceive you:
Mark 13:6	For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.
Mark 13:7	And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet.
Mark 13:8	For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows.
Mark 13:9	But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.
Mark 13:10	And the gospel must first be published among all nations.
Mark 13:11	But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.
Mark 13:12	Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.
Mark 13:13	And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.
Mark 13:14	But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:
Mark 13:15	And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house:
Mark 13:16	And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment.
Mark 13:17	But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!
Mark 13:18	And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.
Mark 13:19	For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be.
Mark 13:20	And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.
Mark 13:21	And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, lo, he is there; believe him not:
Mark 13:22	For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.
Mark 13:23	But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.
Mark 13:24	But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,
Mark 13:25	And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.
Mark 13:26	And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.
Mark 13:27	And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.
Mark 13:28	Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near:
Mark 13:29	So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh, even at the doors.
Mark 13:30	Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done.
Mark 13:31	Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.
Mark 13:32	But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.
Mark 13:33	Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.
Mark 13:34	For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch.
Mark 13:35	Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning:
Mark 13:36	Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.
Mark 13:37	And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.
Mark 14:1	After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and put him to death.
Mark 14:2	But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of the people.
Mark 14:3	And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured it on his head.
Mark 14:4	And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?
Mark 14:5	For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her.
Mark 14:6	And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me.
Mark 14:7	For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.
Mark 14:8	She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.
Mark 14:9	Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.
Mark 14:10	And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them.
Mark 14:11	And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.
Mark 14:12	And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?
Mark 14:13	And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.
Mark 14:14	And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?
Mark 14:15	And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.
Mark 14:16	And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.
Mark 14:17	And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.
Mark 14:18	And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.
Mark 14:19	And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?
Mark 14:20	And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish.
Mark 14:21	The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born.
Mark 14:22	And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.
Mark 14:23	And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it.
Mark 14:24	And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.
Mark 14:25	Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.
Mark 14:26	And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.
Mark 14:27	And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.
Mark 14:28	But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.
Mark 14:29	But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I.
Mark 14:30	And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.
Mark 14:31	But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.
Mark 14:32	And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.
Mark 14:33	And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;
Mark 14:34	And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.
Mark 14:35	And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.
Mark 14:36	And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.
Mark 14:37	And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?
Mark 14:38	Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.
Mark 14:39	And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.
Mark 14:40	And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.
Mark 14:41	And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
Mark 14:42	Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.
Mark 14:43	And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
Mark 14:44	And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely.
Mark 14:45	And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him.
Mark 14:46	And they laid their hands on him, and took him.
Mark 14:47	And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
Mark 14:48	And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?
Mark 14:49	I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.
Mark 14:50	And they all forsook him, and fled.
Mark 14:51	And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:
Mark 14:52	And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.
Mark 14:53	And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.
Mark 14:54	And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.
Mark 14:55	And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.
Mark 14:56	For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together.
Mark 14:57	And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,
Mark 14:58	We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.
Mark 14:59	But neither so did their witness agree together.
Mark 14:60	And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?
Mark 14:61	But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?
Mark 14:62	And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.
Mark 14:63	Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?
Mark 14:64	Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.
Mark 14:65	And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.
Mark 14:66	And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:
Mark 14:67	And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.
Mark 14:68	But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.
Mark 14:69	And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.
Mark 14:70	And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.
Mark 14:71	But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak.
Mark 14:72	And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.
Mark 15:1	And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.
Mark 15:2	And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto them, Thou sayest it.
Mark 15:3	And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.
Mark 15:4	And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.
Mark 15:5	But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.
Mark 15:6	Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.
Mark 15:7	And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.
Mark 15:8	And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them.
Mark 15:9	But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?
Mark 15:10	For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.
Mark 15:11	But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.
Mark 15:12	And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?
Mark 15:13	And they cried out again, Crucify him.
Mark 15:14	Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.
Mark 15:15	And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.
Mark 15:16	And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.
Mark 15:17	And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,
Mark 15:18	And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!
Mark 15:19	And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.
Mark 15:20	And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.
Mark 15:21	And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.
Mark 15:22	And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.
Mark 15:23	And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.
Mark 15:24	And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.
Mark 15:25	And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.
Mark 15:26	And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
Mark 15:27	And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.
Mark 15:28	And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.
Mark 15:29	And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,
Mark 15:30	Save thyself, and come down from the cross.
Mark 15:31	Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.
Mark 15:32	Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.
Mark 15:33	And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.
Mark 15:34	And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
Mark 15:35	And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias.
Mark 15:36	And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.
Mark 15:37	And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.
Mark 15:38	And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.
Mark 15:39	And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.
Mark 15:40	There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;
Mark 15:41	(Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.
Mark 15:42	And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,
Mark 15:43	Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.
Mark 15:44	And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.
Mark 15:45	And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.
Mark 15:46	And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.
Mark 15:47	And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.
Mark 16:1	And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.
Mark 16:2	And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.
Mark 16:3	And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?
Mark 16:4	And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.
Mark 16:5	And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.
Mark 16:6	And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.
Mark 16:7	But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.
Mark 16:8	And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid.
Mark 16:9	Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.
Mark 16:10	And she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.
Mark 16:11	And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.
Mark 16:12	After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country.
Mark 16:13	And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed they them.
Mark 16:14	Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen.
Mark 16:15	And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.
Mark 16:16	He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.
Mark 16:17	And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;
Mark 16:18	They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.
Mark 16:19	So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.
Mark 16:20	And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.
Luke 1:1	Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,
Luke 1:2	Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;
Luke 1:3	It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,
Luke 1:4	That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.
Luke 1:5	THERE was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.
Luke 1:6	And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.
Luke 1:7	And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were now well stricken in years.
Luke 1:8	And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course,
Luke 1:9	According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.
Luke 1:10	And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.
Luke 1:11	And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.
Luke 1:12	And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.
Luke 1:13	But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.
Luke 1:14	And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.
Luke 1:15	For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.
Luke 1:16	And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.
Luke 1:17	And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.
Luke 1:18	And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.
Luke 1:19	And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.
Luke 1:20	And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.
Luke 1:21	And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.
Luke 1:22	And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.
Luke 1:23	And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.
Luke 1:24	And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,
Luke 1:25	Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.
Luke 1:26	And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,
