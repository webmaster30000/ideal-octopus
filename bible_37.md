Proverbs 1:1	The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;
Proverbs 1:2	To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;
Proverbs 1:3	To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;
Proverbs 1:4	To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.
Proverbs 1:5	A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:
Proverbs 1:6	To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.
Proverbs 1:7	The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.
Proverbs 1:8	My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:
Proverbs 1:9	For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.
Proverbs 1:10	My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.
Proverbs 1:11	If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:
Proverbs 1:12	Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:
Proverbs 1:13	We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:
Proverbs 1:14	Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:
Proverbs 1:15	My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:
Proverbs 1:16	For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.
Proverbs 1:17	Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.
Proverbs 1:18	And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives.
Proverbs 1:19	So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof.
Proverbs 1:20	Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:
Proverbs 1:21	She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,
Proverbs 1:22	How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?
Proverbs 1:23	Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.
Proverbs 1:24	Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;
Proverbs 1:25	But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:
Proverbs 1:26	I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;
Proverbs 1:27	When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.
Proverbs 1:28	Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:
Proverbs 1:29	For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:
Proverbs 1:30	They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.
Proverbs 1:31	Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.

Proverbs 2:1	My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;
Proverbs 2:2	So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding;
Proverbs 2:3	Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding;
Proverbs 2:4	If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures;
Proverbs 2:5	Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.
Proverbs 2:6	For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.
Proverbs 2:7	He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.
Proverbs 2:8	He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.
Proverbs 2:9	Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path.
Proverbs 2:10	When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;
Proverbs 2:11	Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:
Proverbs 2:12	To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things;
Proverbs 2:13	Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;
Proverbs 2:14	Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked;
Proverbs 2:15	Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths:
Proverbs 2:16	To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words;
Proverbs 2:17	Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.
Proverbs 2:18	For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.
Proverbs 2:19	None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.
Proverbs 2:20	That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.
Proverbs 2:21	For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.
Proverbs 2:22	But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.
Proverbs 3:1	My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments:
Proverbs 3:2	For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.
Proverbs 3:3	Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:
Proverbs 3:4	So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.
Proverbs 3:5	Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.
Proverbs 3:6	In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.
Proverbs 3:7	Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.
Proverbs 3:8	It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.
Proverbs 3:9	Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:
