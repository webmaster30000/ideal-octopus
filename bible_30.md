Job 3:1	After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.
Job 3:2	And Job spake, and said,
Job 3:3	Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived.
Job 3:4	Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.|
Job 3:5	Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.
Job 3:6	As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.
Job 3:7	Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.
Job 3:8	Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.
Job 3:9	Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:
Job 3:10	Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.
Job 3:11	Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?
Job 3:12	Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?
Job 3:13	For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,
Job 3:14	With kings and counsellors of the earth, which build desolate places for themselves;
Job 3:15	Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:
Job 3:16	Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.
Job 3:17	There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.
Job 3:18	There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.
Job 3:19	The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.
Job 3:20	Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul;
Job 3:21	Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;
Job 3:22	Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?
Job 3:23	Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?
Job 3:24	For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.
Job 3:25	For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.
Job 3:26	I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.
Job 4:1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
Job 4:2	If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?
Job 4:3	Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.
Job 4:4	Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.
Job 4:5	But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.
Job 4:6	Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?
Job 4:7	Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?
Job 4:8	Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.
Job 4:9	By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.
Job 4:10	The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.
Job 4:11	The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.
Job 4:12	Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.
Job 4:13	In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,
Job 4:14	Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.
Job 4:15	Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:
Job 4:16	It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,
Job 4:17	Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?
Job 4:18	Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:
Job 4:19	How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?
Job 4:20	They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.
Job 4:21	Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.
Job 5:1	Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?
Job 5:2	For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.
Job 5:3	I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.
Job 5:4	His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them.
Job 5:5	Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.
Job 5:6	Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;
Job 5:7	Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.
Job 5:8	I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:
Job 5:9	Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:
Job 5:10	Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:
Job 5:11	To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.
Job 5:12	He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.
Job 5:13	He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.
Job 5:14	They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope in the noonday as in the night.
Job 5:15	But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.
Job 5:16	So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.
Job 5:17	Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:
Job 5:18	For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.
Job 5:19	He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.
Job 5:20	In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword.
Job 5:21	Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.
Job 5:22	At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
Job 5:23	For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.
Job 5:24	And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.
Job 5:25	Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.
Job 5:26	Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.
Job 5:27	Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy good.
Job 6:1	But Job answered and said,
Job 6:2	Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!
Job 6:3	For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.
Job 6:4	For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.
Job 6:5	Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?
Job 6:6	Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
Job 6:7	The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat.
Job 6:8	Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!
Job 6:9	Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!
Job 6:10	Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.
Job 6:11	What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life?
Job 6:12	Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?
Job 6:13	Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?
Job 6:14	To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.
Job 6:15	My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away;
Job 6:16	Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid:
Job 6:17	What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.
Job 6:18	The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.
Job 6:19	The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.
Job 6:20	They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.
Job 6:21	For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid.
Job 6:22	Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?
Job 6:23	Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?
Job 6:24	Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.
Job 6:25	How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?
Job 6:26	Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind?
Job 6:27	Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend.
Job 6:28	Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie.
Job 6:29	Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness is in it.
Job 6:30	Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?
Job 7:1	Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the days of an hireling?
Job 7:2	As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work:
Job 7:3	So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.
Job 7:4	When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.
Job 7:5	My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome.
Job 7:6	My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.
Job 7:7	O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.
Job 7:8	The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.
Job 7:9	As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more.
Job 7:10	He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.
Job 7:11	Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
Job 7:12	Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?
Job 7:13	When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaints;
Job 7:14	Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:
Job 7:15	So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life.
Job 7:16	I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity.
Job 7:17	What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?
Job 7:18	And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment?
Job 7:19	How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?
Job 7:20	I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?
Job 7:21	And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.
Job 8:1	Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
Job 8:2	How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?
Job 8:3	Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?
Job 8:4	If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;
Job 8:5	If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;
Job 8:6	If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.
Job 8:7	Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.
Job 8:8	For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:
Job 8:9	(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:)
Job 8:10	Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?
Job 8:11	Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?
Job 8:12	Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb.
Job 8:13	So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish:
Job 8:14	Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider's web.
Job 8:15	He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.
Job 8:16	He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.
Job 8:17	His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones.
Job 8:18	If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.
Job 8:19	Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.
Job 8:20	Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers:
Job 8:21	Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing.
Job 8:22	They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.
Job 9:1	Then Job answered and said,
Job 9:2	I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?
Job 9:3	If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.
Job 9:4	He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered?
Job 9:5	Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger.
Job 9:6	Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.
Job 9:7	Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.
Job 9:8	Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.
Job 9:9	Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.
Job 9:10	Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number.
Job 9:11	Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.
Job 9:12	Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou?
Job 9:13	If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.
Job 9:14	How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him?
Job 9:15	Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge.
Job 9:16	If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.
Job 9:17	For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.
Job 9:18	He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.
Job 9:19	If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead?
Job 9:20	If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.
Job 9:21	Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.
Job 9:22	This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.
Job 9:23	If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.
Job 9:24	The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?
Job 9:25	Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.
Job 9:26	They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey.
Job 9:27	If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself:
Job 9:28	I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.
Job 9:29	If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?
Job 9:30	If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;
Job 9:31	Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.
Job 9:32	For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment.
Job 9:33	Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both.
Job 9:34	Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:
Job 9:35	Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me.
Job 10:1	My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
Job 10:2	I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.
Job 10:3	Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?
Job 10:4	Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?
Job 10:5	Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man's days,
Job 10:6	That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin?
Job 10:7	Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand.
Job 10:8	Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.
Job 10:9	Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?
Job 10:10	Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?
Job 10:11	Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.
Job 10:12	Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.
Job 10:13	And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this is with thee.
Job 10:14	If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.
Job 10:15	If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction;
Job 10:16	For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.
Job 10:17	Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war are against me.
Job 10:18	Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!
Job 10:19	I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.
Job 10:20	Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,
Job 10:21	Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;
Job 10:22	A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness.
Job 11:1	Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
Job 11:2	Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified?
Job 11:3	Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?
Job 11:4	For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes.
Job 11:5	But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;
Job 11:6	And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.
Job 11:7	Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?
Job 11:8	It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?
Job 11:9	The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.
Job 11:10	If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him?
Job 11:11	For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider it?
Job 11:12	For vain men would be wise, though man be born like a wild ass's colt.
Job 11:13	If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him;
Job 11:14	If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.
Job 11:15	For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:
Job 11:16	Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as waters that pass away:
Job 11:17	And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday: thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.
Job 11:18	And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.
Job 11:19	Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee.
Job 11:20	But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.
Job 12:1	And Job answered and said,
Job 12:2	No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.
Job 12:3	But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?
Job 12:4	I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn.
Job 12:5	He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.
Job 12:6	The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.
Job 12:7	But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:
Job 12:8	Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.
Job 12:9	Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?
Job 12:10	In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.
Job 12:11	Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?
Job 12:12	With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding.
Job 12:13	With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding.
Job 12:14	Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.
Job 12:15	Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.
Job 12:16	With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver are his.
Job 12:17	He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools.
Job 12:18	He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle.
Job 12:19	He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.
Job 12:20	He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged.
Job 12:21	He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty.
Job 12:22	He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death.
Job 12:23	He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them again.
Job 12:24	He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.
Job 12:25	They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.
Job 13:1	Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and understood it.
Job 13:2	What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you.
Job 13:3	Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.
Job 13:4	But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value.
Job 13:5	O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom.
Job 13:6	Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.
Job 13:7	Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?
Job 13:8	Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?
Job 13:9	Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye so mock him?
Job 13:10	He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons.
Job 13:11	Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you?
Job 13:12	Your remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay.
Job 13:13	Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what will.
Job 13:14	Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand?
Job 13:15	Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him.
Job 13:16	He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him.
Job 13:17	Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.
Job 13:18	Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be justified.
Job 13:19	Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost.
Job 13:20	Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee.
Job 13:21	Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid.
Job 13:22	Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me.
Job 13:23	How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin.
Job 13:24	Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?
Job 13:25	Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?
Job 13:26	For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.
Job 13:27	Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet.
Job 13:28	And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten.
Job 14:1	Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble.
Job 14:2	He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.
Job 14:3	And doth thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee?
Job 14:4	Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.
Job 14:5	Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;
Job 14:6	Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day.
Job 14:7	For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.
Job 14:8	Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground;
Job 14:9	Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.
Job 14:10	But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?
Job 14:11	As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up:
Job 14:12	So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.
Job 14:13	O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!
Job 14:14	If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.
Job 14:15	Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.
Job 14:16	For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin?
Job 14:17	My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity.
Job 14:18	And surely the mountains falling cometh to nought, and the rock is removed out of his place.
Job 14:19	The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man.
Job 14:20	Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.
Job 14:21	His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.
Job 14:22	But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.
Job 15:1	Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,
Job 15:2	Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?
Job 15:3	Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?
Job 15:4	Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.
Job 15:5	For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.
Job 15:6	Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee.
Job 15:7	Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before the hills?
Job 15:8	Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?
Job 15:9	What knowest thou, that we know not? what understandest thou, which is not in us?
Job 15:10	With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father.
Job 15:11	Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?
Job 15:12	Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,
Job 15:13	That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such words go out of thy mouth?
Job 15:14	What is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?
Job 15:15	Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.
Job 15:16	How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water?
Job 15:17	I will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will declare;
Job 15:18	Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it:
Job 15:19	Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.
Job 15:20	The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.
Job 15:21	A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.
Job 15:22	He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword.
Job 15:23	He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.
Job 15:24	Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.
Job 15:25	For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.
Job 15:26	He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers:
Job 15:27	Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on his flanks.
Job 15:28	And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.
Job 15:29	He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.
Job 15:30	He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.
Job 15:31	Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence.
Job 15:32	It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.
Job 15:33	He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.
Job 15:34	For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.
Job 15:35	They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit.
Job 16:1	Then Job answered and said,
Job 16:2	I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all.
Job 16:3	Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?
Job 16:4	I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you.
Job 16:5	But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief.
Job 16:6	Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased?
Job 16:7	But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.
Job 16:8	And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.
Job 16:9	He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.
Job 16:10	They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.
Job 16:11	God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.
Job 16:12	I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.
Job 16:13	His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.
Job 16:14	He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.
Job 16:15	I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.
Job 16:16	My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death;
Job 16:17	Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure.
Job 16:18	O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.
Job 16:19	Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high.
Job 16:20	My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.
Job 16:21	O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour!
Job 16:22	When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall not return.
Job 17:1	My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me.
Job 17:2	Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation?
Job 17:3	Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me?
Job 17:4	For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them.
Job 17:5	He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.
Job 17:6	He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret.
Job 17:7	Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shadow.
Job 17:8	Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite.
Job 17:9	The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.
Job 17:10	But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find one wise man among you.
Job 17:11	My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart.
Job 17:12	They change the night into day: the light is short because of darkness.
Job 17:13	If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness.
Job 17:14	I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister.
Job 17:15	And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?
Job 17:16	They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust.
Job 18:1	Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
Job 18:2	How long will it be ere ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak.
Job 18:3	Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your sight?
Job 18:4	He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?
Job 18:5	Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.
Job 18:6	The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him.
Job 18:7	The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.
Job 18:8	For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare.
Job 18:9	The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall prevail against him.
Job 18:10	The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way.
Job 18:11	Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet.
Job 18:12	His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction shall be ready at his side.
Job 18:13	It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength.
Job 18:14	His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors.
Job 18:15	It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.
Job 18:16	His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off.
Job 18:17	His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.
Job 18:18	He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.
Job 18:19	He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings.
Job 18:20	They that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted.
Job 18:21	Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God.
Job 19:1	Then Job answered and said,
Job 19:2	How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?
Job 19:3	These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me.
Job 19:4	And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.
Job 19:5	If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach:
Job 19:6	Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net.
Job 19:7	Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.
Job 19:8	He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.
Job 19:9	He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head.
Job 19:10	He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.
Job 19:11	He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies.
Job 19:12	His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.
Job 19:13	He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.
Job 19:14	My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.
Job 19:15	They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.
Job 19:16	I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him with my mouth.
Job 19:17	My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children's sake of mine own body.
Job 19:18	Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me.
Job 19:19	All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.
Job 19:20	My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.
Job 19:21	Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.
Job 19:22	Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?
Job 19:23	Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!
Job 19:24	That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!
Job 19:25	For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:
Job 19:26	And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God:
Job 19:27	Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me.
Job 19:28	But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?
Job 19:29	Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.
Job 20:1	Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
Job 20:2	Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste.
Job 20:3	I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer.
Job 20:4	Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth,
Job 20:5	That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment?
Job 20:6	Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds;
Job 20:7	Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where is he?
Job 20:8	He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.
Job 20:9	The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.
Job 20:10	His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods.
Job 20:11	His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust.
Job 20:12	Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue;
Job 20:13	Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth:
Job 20:14	Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps within him.
Job 20:15	He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.
Job 20:16	He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay him.
Job 20:17	He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter.
Job 20:18	That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down: according to his substance shall the restitution be, and he shall not rejoice therein.
Job 20:19	Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;
Job 20:20	Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired.
Job 20:21	There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods.
Job 20:22	In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.
Job 20:23	When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating.
