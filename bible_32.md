Job 38:2	Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?
Job 38:3	Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.
Job 38:4	Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.
Job 38:5	Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?
Job 38:6	Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;
Job 38:7	When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
Job 38:8	Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb?
Job 38:9	When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,
Job 38:10	And brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors,
Job 38:11	And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?
Job 38:12	Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the dayspring to know his place;
Job 38:13	That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?
Job 38:14	It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment.
Job 38:15	And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be broken.
Job 38:16	Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?
Job 38:17	Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?
Job 38:18	Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all.
Job 38:19	Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness, where is the place thereof,
Job 38:20	That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?
Job 38:21	Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born? or because the number of thy days is great?
Job 38:22	Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,
Job 38:23	Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?
Job 38:24	By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the east wind upon the earth?
Job 38:25	Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;
Job 38:26	To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the wilderness, wherein there is no man;
Job 38:27	To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?
Job 38:28	Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?
Job 38:29	Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?
Job 38:30	The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.
Job 38:31	Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?
Job 38:32	Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?
Job 38:33	Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?
Job 38:34	Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?
Job 38:35	Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go and say unto thee, Here we are?
Job 38:36	Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart?
Job 38:37	Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven,
Job 38:38	When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together?
Job 38:39	Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions,
Job 38:40	When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait?
Job 38:41	Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat.
Job 39:1	Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?
Job 39:2	Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?
Job 39:3	They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows.
Job 39:4	Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not unto them.
Job 39:5	Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?
Job 39:6	Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings.
Job 39:7	He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver.
Job 39:8	The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing.
Job 39:9	Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib?
Job 39:10	Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?
Job 39:11	Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?
Job 39:12	Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy barn?
Job 39:13	Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich?
Job 39:14	Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust,
Job 39:15	And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them.
Job 39:16	She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not her's: her labour is in vain without fear;
Job 39:17	Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding.
Job 39:18	What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider.
Job 39:19	Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?
Job 39:20	Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible.
Job 39:21	He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men.
Job 39:22	He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword.
Job 39:23	The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield.
Job 39:24	He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet.
Job 39:25	He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.
Job 39:26	Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south?
Job 39:27	Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high?
Job 39:28	She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.
Job 39:29	From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off.
Job 39:30	Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are, there is she.
Job 40:1	Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,
Job 40:2	Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it.
Job 40:3	Then Job answered the LORD, and said,
Job 40:4	Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.
Job 40:5	Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.
Job 40:6	Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
Job 40:7	Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.
Job 40:8	Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?
Job 40:9	Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?
Job 40:10	Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty.
Job 40:11	Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is proud, and abase him.
Job 40:12	Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.
Job 40:13	Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret.
Job 40:14	Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.
Job 40:15	Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.
Job 40:16	Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly.
Job 40:17	He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.
Job 40:18	His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron.
Job 40:19	He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him.
Job 40:20	Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.
Job 40:21	He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.
Job 40:22	The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.
Job 40:23	Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.
Job 40:24	He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.
Job 41:1	Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?
Job 41:2	Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?
Job 41:3	Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto thee?
Job 41:4	Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?
Job 41:5	Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?
Job 41:6	Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants?
Job 41:7	Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?
Job 41:8	Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.
Job 41:9	Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?
Job 41:10	None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?
Job 41:11	Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.
Job 41:12	I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.
Job 41:13	Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double bridle?
Job 41:14	Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about.
Job 41:15	His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.
Job 41:16	One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.
Job 41:17	They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.
Job 41:18	By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.
Job 41:19	Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.
Job 41:20	Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.
Job 41:21	His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.
Job 41:22	In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.
Job 41:23	The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.
Job 41:24	His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone.
Job 41:25	When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.
Job 41:26	The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.
Job 41:27	He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.
Job 41:28	The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.
Job 41:29	Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.
Job 41:30	Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.
Job 41:31	He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.
Job 41:32	He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.
Job 41:33	Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.
Job 41:34	He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride.
Job 42:1	Then Job answered the LORD, and said,
Job 42:2	I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be withholden from thee.
Job 42:3	Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.
Job 42:4	Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.
Job 42:5	I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee.
Job 42:6	Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.
Job 42:7	And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.
Job 42:8	Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.
Job 42:9	So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job.
Job 42:10	And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.
Job 42:11	Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.
Job 42:12	So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.
Job 42:13	He had also seven sons and three daughters.
Job 42:14	And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.
Job 42:15	And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.
Job 42:16	After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.
Job 42:17	So Job died, being old and full of days.
Psalms 1:1	Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.
Psalms 1:2	But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.
Psalms 1:3	And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.
Psalms 1:4	The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.
Psalms 1:5	Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
Psalms 1:6	For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.
Psalms 2:1	Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?
Psalms 2:2	The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying,
Psalms 2:3	Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.
Psalms 2:4	He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall have them in derision.
Psalms 2:5	Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.
Psalms 2:6	Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.
Psalms 2:7	I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.
Psalms 2:8	Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.
Psalms 2:9	Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.
Psalms 2:10	Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.
Psalms 2:11	Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
Psalms 2:12	Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.
Psalms 3:1	Lord, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they that rise up against me.
Psalms 3:2	Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah.
Psalms 3:3	But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.
Psalms 3:4	I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah.
Psalms 3:5	I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.
Psalms 3:6	I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about.
Psalms 3:7	Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.
Psalms 3:8	Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy people. Selah.
Psalms 4:1	Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.
Psalms 4:2	O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah.
Psalms 4:3	But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.
Psalms 4:4	Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.
Psalms 4:5	Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD.
Psalms 4:6	There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.
Psalms 4:7	Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased.
Psalms 4:8	I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only makest me dwell in safety.
Psalms 5:1	Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.
Psalms 5:2	Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray.
Psalms 5:3	My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.
Psalms 5:4	For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.
Psalms 5:5	The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.
Psalms 5:6	Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.
Psalms 5:7	But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.
Psalms 5:8	Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face.
Psalms 5:9	For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.
Psalms 5:10	Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.
Psalms 5:11	But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.
Psalms 5:12	For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.
Psalms 6:1	O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
Psalms 6:2	Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed.
Psalms 6:3	My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?
Psalms 6:4	Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies' sake.
Psalms 6:5	For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?
Psalms 6:6	I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.
Psalms 6:7	Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies.
Psalms 6:8	Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping.
Psalms 6:9	The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer.
Psalms 6:10	Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return and be ashamed suddenly.
Psalms 7:1	O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:
Psalms 7:2	Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.
Psalms 7:3	O LORD my God, If I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;
Psalms 7:4	If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)
Psalms 7:5	Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.
Psalms 7:6	Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded.
Psalms 7:7	So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high.
Psalms 7:8	The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me.
Psalms 7:9	Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.
Psalms 7:10	My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.
Psalms 7:11	God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day.
Psalms 7:12	If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.
Psalms 7:13	He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.
Psalms 7:14	Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.
Psalms 7:15	He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.
Psalms 7:16	His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.
Psalms 7:17	I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.
Psalms 8:1	O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens.
Psalms 8:2	Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.
Psalms 8:3	When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;
Psalms 8:4	What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?
Psalms 8:5	For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.
Psalms 8:6	Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet:
Psalms 8:7	All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;
Psalms 8:8	The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.
Psalms 8:9	O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!
Psalms 9:1	I will praise thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.
Psalms 9:2	I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High.
Psalms 9:3	When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence.
Psalms 9:4	For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right.
Psalms 9:5	Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.
Psalms 9:6	O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.
Psalms 9:7	But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment.
Psalms 9:8	And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.
Psalms 9:9	The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.
Psalms 9:10	And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.
Psalms 9:11	Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings.
Psalms 9:12	When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble.
Psalms 9:13	Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:
Psalms 9:14	That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.
Psalms 9:15	The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.
Psalms 9:16	The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.
Psalms 9:17	The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.
Psalms 9:18	For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever.
Psalms 9:19	Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight.
Psalms 9:20	Put them in fear, O LORD: that the nations may know themselves to be but men. Selah.
Psalms 10:1	Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?
Psalms 10:2	The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.
Psalms 10:3	For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.
Psalms 10:4	The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.
Psalms 10:5	His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.
Psalms 10:6	He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity.
Psalms 10:7	His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity.
Psalms 10:8	He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor.
Psalms 10:9	He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net.
Psalms 10:10	He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones.
Psalms 10:11	He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see it.
Psalms 10:12	Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble.
Psalms 10:13	Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it.
Psalms 10:14	Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.
Psalms 10:15	Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his wickedness till thou find none.
Psalms 10:16	The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land.
Psalms 10:17	LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:
