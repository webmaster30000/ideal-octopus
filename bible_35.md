Psalms 78:17	And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.
Psalms 78:18	And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.
Psalms 78:19	Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?
Psalms 78:20	Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?
Psalms 78:21	Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;
Psalms 78:22	Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:
Psalms 78:23	Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,
Psalms 78:24	And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.
Psalms 78:25	Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.
Psalms 78:26	He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.
Psalms 78:27	He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:
Psalms 78:28	And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.
Psalms 78:29	So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;
Psalms 78:30	They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths,
Psalms 78:31	The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.
Psalms 78:32	For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.
Psalms 78:33	Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.
Psalms 78:34	When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.
Psalms 78:35	And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.
Psalms 78:36	Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.
Psalms 78:37	For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.
Psalms 78:38	But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.
Psalms 78:39	For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.
Psalms 78:40	How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!
Psalms 78:41	Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.
Psalms 78:42	They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.
Psalms 78:43	How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan.
Psalms 78:44	And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.
Psalms 78:45	He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.
Psalms 78:46	He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.
Psalms 78:47	He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.
Psalms 78:48	He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
Psalms 78:49	He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.
Psalms 78:50	He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;
Psalms 78:51	And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:
Psalms 78:52	But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
Psalms 78:53	And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
Psalms 78:54	And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.
Psalms 78:55	He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
Psalms 78:56	Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:
Psalms 78:57	But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
Psalms 78:58	For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
Psalms 78:59	When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:
Psalms 78:60	So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;
Psalms 78:61	And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.
Psalms 78:62	He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.
Psalms 78:63	The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.
Psalms 78:64	Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.
Psalms 78:65	Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.
Psalms 78:66	And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.
Psalms 78:67	Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:
Psalms 78:68	But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.
Psalms 78:69	And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.
Psalms 78:70	He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:
Psalms 78:71	From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
Psalms 78:72	So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
Psalms 79:1	O god, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.
Psalms 79:2	The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.
Psalms 79:3	Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and there was none to bury them.
Psalms 79:4	We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.
Psalms 79:5	How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire?
Psalms 79:6	Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.
Psalms 79:7	For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.
Psalms 79:8	O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.
Psalms 79:9	Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.
Psalms 79:10	Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed.
Psalms 79:11	Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die;
Psalms 79:12	And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.
Psalms 79:13	So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.
Psalms 80:1	Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth.
Psalms 80:2	Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come and save us.
Psalms 80:3	Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
Psalms 80:4	O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?
Psalms 80:5	Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure.
Psalms 80:6	Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves.
Psalms 80:7	Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
Psalms 80:8	Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.
Psalms 80:9	Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land.
Psalms 80:10	The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars.
Psalms 80:11	She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river.
Psalms 80:12	Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?
Psalms 80:13	The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it.
Psalms 80:14	Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;
Psalms 80:15	And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself.
Psalms 80:16	It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.
Psalms 80:17	Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.
Psalms 80:18	So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name.
Psalms 80:19	Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
Psalms 81:1	Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.
Psalms 81:2	Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery.
Psalms 81:3	Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.
Psalms 81:4	For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob.
Psalms 81:5	This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I understood not.
Psalms 81:6	I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots.
Psalms 81:7	Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah.
Psalms 81:8	Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me;
Psalms 81:9	There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god.
Psalms 81:10	I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.
Psalms 81:11	But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me.
Psalms 81:12	So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they walked in their own counsels.
Psalms 81:13	Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways!
Psalms 81:14	I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.
Psalms 81:15	The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever.
Psalms 81:16	He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.
Psalms 82:1	God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods.
Psalms 82:2	How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah.
Psalms 82:3	Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy.
Psalms 82:4	Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked.
Psalms 82:5	They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.
Psalms 82:6	I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.
Psalms 82:7	But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.
Psalms 82:8	Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.
Psalms 83:1	Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.
Psalms 83:2	For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.
Psalms 83:3	They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.
Psalms 83:4	They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
Psalms 83:5	For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee:
Psalms 83:6	The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;
Psalms 83:7	Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;
Psalms 83:8	Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah.
Psalms 83:9	Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison:
Psalms 83:10	Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.
Psalms 83:11	Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:
Psalms 83:12	Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.
Psalms 83:13	O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.
Psalms 83:14	As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;
Psalms 83:15	So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm.
Psalms 83:16	Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD.
Psalms 83:17	Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:
Psalms 83:18	That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth.
Psalms 84:1	How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!
Psalms 84:2	My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.
Psalms 84:3	Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God.
Psalms 84:4	Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. Selah.
Psalms 84:5	Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them.
Psalms 84:6	Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools.
Psalms 84:7	They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God.
Psalms 84:8	O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.
Psalms 84:9	Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed.
Psalms 84:10	For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
Psalms 84:11	For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.
Psalms 84:12	O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.
Psalms 85:1	Lord, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob.
Psalms 85:2	Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all their sin. Selah.
Psalms 85:3	Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger.
Psalms 85:4	Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease.
Psalms 85:5	Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?
Psalms 85:6	Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee?
Psalms 85:7	Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation.
Psalms 85:8	I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly.
Psalms 85:9	Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land.
Psalms 85:10	Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
Psalms 85:11	Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven.
Psalms 85:12	Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase.
Psalms 85:13	Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way of his steps.
Psalms 86:1	Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I am poor and needy.
Psalms 86:2	Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee.
Psalms 86:3	Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.
Psalms 86:4	Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
Psalms 86:5	For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.
Psalms 86:6	Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications.
Psalms 86:7	In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me.
Psalms 86:8	Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are there any works like unto thy works.
Psalms 86:9	All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.
Psalms 86:10	For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone.
Psalms 86:11	Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.
Psalms 86:12	I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify thy name for evermore.
Psalms 86:13	For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell.
Psalms 86:14	O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul; and have not set thee before them.
Psalms 86:15	But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.
Psalms 86:16	O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.
Psalms 86:17	Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it, and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted me.
Psalms 87:1	His foundation is in the holy mountains.
Psalms 87:2	The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
Psalms 87:3	Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah.
Psalms 87:4	I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there.
Psalms 87:5	And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her: and the highest himself shall establish her.
Psalms 87:6	The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this man was born there. Selah.
Psalms 87:7	As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there: all my springs are in thee.
Psalms 88:1	O lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee:
Psalms 88:2	Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry;
Psalms 88:3	For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto the grave.
Psalms 88:4	I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man that hath no strength:
Psalms 88:5	Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand.
Psalms 88:6	Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.
Psalms 88:7	Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves. Selah.
Psalms 88:8	Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.
Psalms 88:9	Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.
Psalms 88:10	Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and praise thee? Selah.
Psalms 88:11	Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy faithfulness in destruction?
Psalms 88:12	Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
Psalms 88:13	But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee.
Psalms 88:14	LORD, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face from me?
Psalms 88:15	I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.
Psalms 88:16	Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.
Psalms 88:17	They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together.
Psalms 88:18	Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance into darkness.
Psalms 89:1	I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.
Psalms 89:2	For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.
Psalms 89:3	I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant,
Psalms 89:4	Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations. Selah.
Psalms 89:5	And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.
Psalms 89:6	For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?
Psalms 89:7	God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him.
Psalms 89:8	O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee?
Psalms 89:9	Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.
Psalms 89:10	Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.
Psalms 89:11	The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.
Psalms 89:12	The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.
Psalms 89:13	Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.
Psalms 89:14	Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face.
Psalms 89:15	Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.
Psalms 89:16	In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.
Psalms 89:17	For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted.
Psalms 89:18	For the LORD is our defence; and the Holy One of Israel is our king.
Psalms 89:19	Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.
Psalms 89:20	I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him:
Psalms 89:21	With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall strengthen him.
Psalms 89:22	The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him.
Psalms 89:23	And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him.
Psalms 89:24	But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted.
Psalms 89:25	I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers.
Psalms 89:26	He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.
Psalms 89:27	Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.
Psalms 89:28	My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.
Psalms 89:29	His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.
Psalms 89:30	If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;
Psalms 89:31	If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;
Psalms 89:32	Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.
Psalms 89:33	Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.
Psalms 89:34	My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.
Psalms 89:35	Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.
Psalms 89:36	His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.
Psalms 89:37	It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in heaven. Selah.
Psalms 89:38	But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.
Psalms 89:39	Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.
Psalms 89:40	Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin.
Psalms 89:41	All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his neighbours.
Psalms 89:42	Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.
Psalms 89:43	Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle.
Psalms 89:44	Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground.
Psalms 89:45	The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him with shame. Selah.
Psalms 89:46	How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath burn like fire?
Psalms 89:47	Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vain?
Psalms 89:48	What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.
Psalms 89:49	Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou swarest unto David in thy truth?
Psalms 89:50	Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people;
Psalms 89:51	Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.
Psalms 89:52	Blessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.
Psalms 90:1	Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.
Psalms 90:2	Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.
Psalms 90:3	|Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men.
Psalms 90:4	For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.
Psalms 90:5	Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in the morning they are like grass which groweth up.
Psalms 90:6	In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.
Psalms 90:7	For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled.
Psalms 90:8	Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.
Psalms 90:9	For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a tale that is told.
Psalms 90:10	The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
Psalms 90:11	Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath.
Psalms 90:12	So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.
Psalms 90:13	Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants.
Psalms 90:14	O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
Psalms 90:15	Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil.
Psalms 90:16	Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children.
Psalms 90:17	And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.
Psalms 91:1	He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
Psalms 91:2	I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.
